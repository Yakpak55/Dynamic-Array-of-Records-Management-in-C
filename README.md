# Dynamic-Array-of-Records-Management-in-C
Developed a C program to manage a dynamic array of records, allowing users to insert, display, and remove records efficiently.
The project involved:

● Dynamic Memory Allocation: Implemented functions to dynamically allocate memory for an array of records, ensuring efficient use of resources and the ability to expand as needed.

● Record Management: Created a structure (record_t) to store individual records containing first name, last name, and favorite show, with functions to insert new records and display existing ones.

● Memory Management: Ensured proper memory management by implementing functions to free allocated memory and prevent memory leaks.

● User Interaction: Provided a command-line interface for user interaction, allowing users to insert new records, display all records, remove records by index, and exit the program.
